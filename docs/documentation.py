# Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX) Documentation

## Introduction

Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX) is a novel approach that combines self-refining ML and explanatory interactive learning. The LSX model consists of two submodels (learner and critic) that work together to improve model performance through self-explanation.

This document provides detailed documentation for the LSX implementation, including module descriptions, function signatures, and usage examples.

## Core Modules

### LSX Model

The LSX model is implemented in `models/lsx.py` and consists of two submodels:

1. **Learner**: A neural network that makes predictions on the input data.
2. **Critic**: A neural network that evaluates the quality of explanations.

```python
class LSX(nn.Module):
    """
